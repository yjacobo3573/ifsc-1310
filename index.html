  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2> 
  <p>Progressive enhancement is a methodology that makes the content the most important part of a website and makes it available to everyone regardless of their browser.  
  Moreover, if someone has a browser that allows for advanced code or faster internet connection then they receive an enhanced version of the website, which may include CSS and JavaScript.  
  Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because it makes sure that anyone that has internet access can access the content on a website.  
  This is incredibly important because it doesn’t leave anyone behind and it doesn’t discriminate against people with slow internet connection or old browsers.

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p> I think that overall this semester I did a good job of keeping up with my work and asking questions. Moreover, I learned so many new things in little time and I think that just demonstrates how quick of a learner I am. I passed through lots of moments where I didn’t understand things and I would get frustrated, but now I feel like I have learned the value of patience and perseverance. I have learned the importance of figuring things out on my own and that has led me to know more. If I had to start over I would probably pay more attention to the assigned readings and take more time to experiment with the new things I was learning. It was very difficult to do that because I had so much work for my other classes, however, I would’ve liked to make more time for experiential learning. 
</p> 
<p>Regarding the Dragon Project, I think my final project ended up looking pretty good and I learned a lot in the process of struggling to debug some of my code. Moreover, I think I did well choosing the colors because it ended up looking very unique. If I had to start over I would put in more time to the project and I would maybe make it look more professional. I also wanted to add in more javascript, however, I realized I didn’t have time for it. 
</p> 
<p>I received a lot of feedback from people to change my banner, so that the logo could be seen and I did that by switching the positions of my images using CANVA. Furthermore, people also told me to make my table match the colors of my theme and I fixed that by changing my CSS. I also received some feedback about adding a border bottom to all my pages, so that it would match my FAQ and I fixed that by editing my CSS.  
</p> 
<p>To conclude, I thoroughly enjoyed Web Technologies. It was a pleasure to learn so many new things and I know that all the things I learned will be very helpful in my road ahead. Thank you.
